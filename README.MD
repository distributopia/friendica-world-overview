`WARNING`: This is a __mirror repo__ from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/friendica-world-overview). Please, send your MRs there. PRs here won't be merged.

Nodes are not restricted to their theme. This list may be useful for new users who wish to choose a server by theme

#### :clapper: [Game / Book / Show theme](#entertainment)
* [mordor.social](https://mordor.social) - for orcs and trolls

#### :earth_asia: [Notable generalistic](#notable-generalistic)
* [venera.social](https://venera.social) - friendly humans are welcome

## Disclaimer
`Following nodes skipped`: closed registration *at the moment of checking*, running old code, no themed description.

Add your own themed Friendica node by opening an issue or via [MR](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/friendica-world-overview). If your server already has many users, it will be nice of you to let other servers grow, for a healthier decentralization.
