# :jack_o_lantern: Friendica instances overview

`WARNING`: This is a __mirror repo__ from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/friendica-world-overview). Please, send your MRs there. PRs here won't be merged.

Instances are not restricted to their theme. This list may be useful for new users who wish to choose a server by theme (or just find out what Friendica admins' interests are)

#### Book / Game / Show theme
* https://mordor.social - for orcs and trolls

## Disclaimer
Following instances skipped: closed registration *at the moment of checking*, running old code, no themed description.

Add your own themed Friendica instance by opening an issue or via [MR](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/friendica-world-overview). If your server already has many users, it will be nice of you to let other instances grow, for a healthier decentralization.
