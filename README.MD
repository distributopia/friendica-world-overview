# :rabbit: Friendica nodes overview

`WARNING`: This is a __mirror repo__ from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/friendica-world-overview). Please, send your MRs there. PRs here won't be merged.

Nodes are not restricted to their theme. This list may be useful for new users who wish to choose a server by theme

#### :earth_asia: [Notable generalistic](#notable-generalistic)
* [venera.social](https://venera.social) - friendly humans are welcome
* [meld.de](https://meld.de) - your data is yours, only you decide when, where and how you share it

#### :telescope: [Hobbies](#hobbies)
* [segeln.social](https://segeln.social) - for sailing people (mainly German speaking community)

## Disclaimer
`Following nodes skipped`: closed registration *at the moment of checking*, running old code, no themed description.

Add your own themed Friendica node by opening an issue or via [MR](https://gitlab.com/distributopia/friendica-world-overview). If your server already has many users, it will be nice of you to let other servers grow, for a healthier decentralization.
